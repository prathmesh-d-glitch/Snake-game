# 🐍 Snake Game in Flutter

A modern twist on the classic Snake Game, built with Flutter! This game provides an engaging experience with intuitive swipe controls, dynamic gameplay, and a minimalist design, perfect for mobile users who love retro games. 🎮

## 🎯 Features

- **Fluid Swipe Controls**: The game uses intuitive swipe gestures to control the snake's direction.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive across all screen sizes.
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean, simple layout focusing on gameplay without distractions.
- **Dynamic Speed**: Snake speed increases as the game progresses, adding a fun challenge.

## 🎮 Game Controls

- **Swipe Left**: Move the snake left.
- **Swipe Right**: Move the snake right.
- **Swipe Up**: Move the snake upwards.
- **Swipe Down**: Move the snake downwards.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The game logic is designed to be smooth and responsive. It uses the **GestureDetector** widget to capture swipe gestures from the user. The snake's movement and game logic are updated with every tick of a timer, and the game progresses as the player navigates through the screen to collect food while avoiding hitting itself.

### Control Panel

The control area covers the full screen, allowing you to swipe anywhere to control the snake, making the experience more intuitive for mobile devices.

### Game Over

If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen, the game will end. A restart button will appear to start the game over from the beginning.
